## Merge and Bubble Sort Comparison

The purpose of this repository is to compare the two algorithms in terms of speed
and memory use. The different scenarios that are accounted for are totally randomly
ordered input, nearly sorted inputs, reversely sorted, and a few uniquely sorted.

Please see the [Wikipedia](https://repos.auc-computing.nl/Tara/Merge_and_Bubble_Sort_Comparison/wikis/home) page 
for the detailed analysis.
